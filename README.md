The code defines two classes, bookShop and buyer, which simulate a book-selling system. The bookShop class tracks the total number of books and available books, and provides static methods for selling and refilling books. The buyer class represents individual buyers, tracks the total number of buyers, and provides a method for buying a book, which interacts with the bookShop class.
